In this program i used python to generate data for a random walk and then matplotlib to create visually appealing representation of the generated data.
A random walk is a path that has no clear direction but is determined by a series of random dicisions, each of which is left entirely to chance.

You might imagine a random walk as the path an ant would take if it has lost it mind and took every step in a random direction.
